I&rsquo;m Moving My Country Dog to the City</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Dear Ava,</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Transitioning a new dog to the city can certainly be stressful, but I do believe that, if your dog can make it in New York City, like the song says, he can make it anywhere.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In fact, some trainers refer to dogs who develop &ldquo;suburban dog syndrome&rdquo; when they&rsquo;re raised behind pPFSCbial white picket fences&mdash; these dogs can end up being easily spooked by novel things since their daily intake of new information is limited to what&rsquo;s within their yard.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even if they get a walk a day, it&rsquo;s unlikely a dog in a rural or suburban neighborhood will encounter more than a handful of new dogs, people, or stimuli in a given walk.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Compare this to the dog who grows up in a metropolitan area and may be exposed to dozens of dogs, hundreds of people, and god-only-knows what kind of stimuli on any given walk. I mean, is that guy approaching us wearing a suit made out of plastic bags and soup cans? Why yes, yes he is.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What&rsquo;s more, behaviors that might be tolerated on a leash when you have all the space in the world may not be safe or desired when you&rsquo;re on a city sidewalk.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fortunately, it&rsquo;s absolutely possible for your dog and you to learn to co-exist happily during what will be a new kind of joint outing. All you need is to focus on how you can socialize your dog to new things, and encourage the behaviors you want during walks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here are some tips on gear and training protocol that will help you both as you transition to city life.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>1. TOSS THAT RETRACTABLE LEASH</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Retractable leashes, which can change length based on the click of a button, mean that the radius wherein a dog can go is not fixed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I don&rsquo;t mind using a retractable leash when I&rsquo;m in a wide open space with my dog, but for leash walking on a busy sidewalk, I think it defeats the major purpose of having your dog on a leash to begin with.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You want to teach your dog that he generally needs to be close to you and that he&rsquo;s allowed with in a fixed radius controlled by the leash, not by his whim.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another problem with retractable leashes is that they usually have very thin cords, which can snap or twist around dog or human body parts. Google &ldquo;Retractable Leash Injuries&rdquo; if you dare.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What&rsquo;s more, if dropped by mistake, their heavy handles can snap towards the dog, which may result in a big plastic handle hurling in the direction of your dog&rsquo;s face, which isn&rsquo;t something you want to risk when there is the possibility of your dog running into traffic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While a leash of this sort might be a nice way for a dog to have some autonomy on a rural trail, it isn&rsquo;t the best fit for city streets.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>2. CARRY TREATS</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Investing in a good treat pouch is a great way to make sure that you always have rewards on you (and don&rsquo;t end up with pockets full of grease and crumbs).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Be liberal with your dispensing of treats&mdash;you want to reward your dog whenever he pays any attention to you, whenever the leash is loose, and whenever he encounters anything that might potentially scare him.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Giving your dog a treat when he spots unusual things (or people or dogs) is a great way to help him forge positive associations with new things. Keep in mind that the treats aren&rsquo;t just for your dog&mdash;they&rsquo;re going to be for people too!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When you have a dog, you&rsquo;re not just training him to behave properly on the street&mdash;you are training people to behave properly, too. Without some coaching from you, you&rsquo;re likely to encounter people who will do a lot of improper things when greeting dogs on the street.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One way to avoid impolite interactions with people who want to say hello to your dog is to hand a treat to anyone that approaches and ask them to give it to your dog.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Your dog shouldn&rsquo;t have to sit for it or do anything for that matter. The &ldquo;trick&rdquo; they&rsquo;re being rewarded for is just the behavior of co-existing with a new human.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>3. CHOOSE YOUR WALKING PATH WISELY</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>There are a million things that could happen on a city street that could spook a dog, most of which you cannot control. The best you can do is try to guess what&rsquo;s going to be the quietest route.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If your dog is small enough and you get stuck in a particularly crowded area, pick up your pup! There is no shame in carrying your dog out of a situation where he could get stepped on.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bonus points for walking on the building side of the sidewalk, rather than by the curb. If your dog does get loose, that extra two or three feet will mean a little bit more of a buffer area where you might be able to grab him before he enters traffic.</p>\r\n', '140f6969d5213fd0ece03148e62e461e_1579610138_6524.jpg', 'dfasfd', 'dsfadsf', '2020-01-21 17:35:38'),

I&rsquo;m Moving My Country Dog to the City</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Dear Ava,</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Transitioning a new dog to the city can certainly be stressful, but I do believe that, if your dog can make it in New York City, like the song says, he can make it anywhere.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In fact, some trainers refer to dogs who develop &ldquo;suburban dog syndrome&rdquo; when they&rsquo;re raised behind pPFSCbial white picket fences&mdash; these dogs can end up being easily spooked by novel things since their daily intake of new information is limited to what&rsquo;s within their yard.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even if they get a walk a day, it&rsquo;s unlikely a dog in a rural or suburban neighborhood will encounter more than a handful of new dogs, people, or stimuli in a given walk.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Compare this to the dog who grows up in a metropolitan area and may be exposed to dozens of dogs, hundreds of people, and god-only-knows what kind of stimuli on any given walk. I mean, is that guy approaching us wearing a suit made out of plastic bags and soup cans? Why yes, yes he is.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What&rsquo;s more, behaviors that might be tolerated on a leash when you have all the space in the world may not be safe or desired when you&rsquo;re on a city sidewalk.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fortunately, it&rsquo;s absolutely possible for your dog and you to learn to co-exist happily during what will be a new kind of joint outing. All you need is to focus on how you can socialize your dog to new things, and encourage the behaviors you want during walks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here are some tips on gear and training protocol that will help you both as you transition to city life.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>1.

Google &ldquo;Retractable Leash Injuries&rdquo; if you dare.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What&rsquo;s more, if dropped by mistake, their heavy handles can snap towards the dog, which may result in a big plastic handle hurling in the direction of your dog&rsquo;s face, which isn&rsquo;t something you want to risk when there is the possibility of your dog running into traffic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While a leash of this sort might be a nice way for a dog to have some autonomy on a rural trail, it isn&rsquo;t the best fit for city streets.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>2.

No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it?

I&rsquo;m Moving My Country Dog to the City</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Dear Ava,</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Transitioning a new dog to the city can certainly be stressful, but I do believe that, if your dog can make it in New York City, like the song says, he can make it anywhere.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In fact, some trainers refer to dogs who develop &ldquo;suburban dog syndrome&rdquo; when they&rsquo;re raised behind pPFSCbial white picket fences&mdash; these dogs can end up being easily spooked by novel things since their daily intake of new information is limited to what&rsquo;s within their yard.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even if they get a walk a day, it&rsquo;s unlikely a dog in a rural or suburban neighborhood will encounter more than a handful of new dogs, people, or stimuli in a given walk.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Compare this to the dog who grows up in a metropolitan area and may be exposed to dozens of dogs, hundreds of people, and god-only-knows what kind of stimuli on any given walk. I mean, is that guy approaching us wearing a suit made out of plastic bags and soup cans? Why yes, yes he is.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What&rsquo;s more, behaviors that might be tolerated on a leash when you have all the space in the world may not be safe or desired when you&rsquo;re on a city sidewalk.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fortunately, it&rsquo;s absolutely possible for your dog and you to learn to co-exist happily during what will be a new kind of joint outing. All you need is to focus on how you can socialize your dog to new things, and encourage the behaviors you want during walks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here are some tips on gear and training protocol that will help you both as you transition to city life.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>1. TOSS THAT RETRACTABLE LEASH</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Retractable leashes, which can change length based on the click of a button, mean that the radius wherein a dog can go is not fixed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I don&rsquo;t mind using a retractable leash when I&rsquo;m in a wide open space with my dog, but for leash walking on a busy sidewalk, I think it defeats the major purpose of having your dog on a leash to begin with.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You want to teach your dog that he generally needs to be close to you and that he&rsquo;s allowed with in a fixed radius controlled by the leash, not by his whim.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another problem with retractable leashes is that they usually have very thin cords, which can snap or twist around dog or human body parts. Google &ldquo;Retractable Leash Injuries&rdquo; if you dare.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What&rsquo;s more, if dropped by mistake, their heavy handles can snap towards the dog, which may result in a big plastic handle hurling in the direction of your dog&rsquo;s face, which isn&rsquo;t something you want to risk when there is the possibility of your dog running into traffic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While a leash of this sort might be a nice way for a dog to have some autonomy on a rural trail, it isn&rsquo;t the best fit for city streets.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>2. CARRY TREATS</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Investing in a good treat pouch is a great way to make sure that you always have rewards on you (and don&rsquo;t end up with pockets full of grease and crumbs).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Be liberal with your dispensing of treats&mdash;you want to reward your dog whenever he pays any attention to you, whenever the leash is loose, and whenever he encounters anything that might potentially scare him.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Giving your dog a treat when he spots unusual things (or people or dogs) is a great way to help him forge positive associations with new things. Keep in mind that the treats aren&rsquo;t just for your dog&mdash;they&rsquo;re going to be for people too!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When you have a dog, you&rsquo;re not just training him to behave properly on the street&mdash;you are training people to behave properly, too. Without some coaching from you, you&rsquo;re likely to encounter people who will do a lot of improper things when greeting dogs on the street.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One way to avoid impolite interactions with people who want to say hello to your dog is to hand a treat to anyone that approaches and ask them to give it to your dog.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Your dog shouldn&rsquo;t have to sit for it or do anything for that matter. The &ldquo;trick&rdquo; they&rsquo;re being rewarded for is just the behavior of co-existing with a new human.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>3. CHOOSE YOUR WALKING PATH WISELY</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>There are a million things that could happen on a city street that could spook a dog, most of which you cannot control. The best you can do is try to guess what&rsquo;s going to be the quietest route.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If your dog is small enough and you get stuck in a particularly crowded area, pick up your pup! There is no shame in carrying your dog out of a situation where he could get stepped on.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bonus points for walking on the building side of the sidewalk, rather than by the curb. If your dog does get loose, that extra two or three feet will mean a little bit more of a buffer area where you might be able to grab him before he enters traffic.</p>\r\n', '210f760a89db30aa72ca258a3483cc7f_1579616145_2448.jpg', 'qewr', 'ewr', '2020-01-21 17:35:38'),

I&rsquo;m Moving My Country Dog to the City</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Dear Ava,</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Transitioning a new dog to the city can certainly be stressful, but I do believe that, if your dog can make it in New York City, like the song says, he can make it anywhere.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In fact, some trainers refer to dogs who develop &ldquo;suburban dog syndrome&rdquo; when they&rsquo;re raised behind pPFSCbial white picket fences&mdash; these dogs can end up being easily spooked by novel things since their daily intake of new information is limited to what&rsquo;s within their yard.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even if they get a walk a day, it&rsquo;s unlikely a dog in a rural or suburban neighborhood will encounter more than a handful of new dogs, people, or stimuli in a given walk.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Compare this to the dog who grows up in a metropolitan area and may be exposed to dozens of dogs, hundreds of people, and god-only-knows what kind of stimuli on any given walk. I mean, is that guy approaching us wearing a suit made out of plastic bags and soup cans? Why yes, yes he is.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What&rsquo;s more, behaviors that might be tolerated on a leash when you have all the space in the world may not be safe or desired when you&rsquo;re on a city sidewalk.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fortunately, it&rsquo;s absolutely possible for your dog and you to learn to co-exist happily during what will be a new kind of joint outing. All you need is to focus on how you can socialize your dog to new things, and encourage the behaviors you want during walks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here are some tips on gear and training protocol that will help you both as you transition to city life.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>1. TOSS THAT RETRACTABLE LEASH</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Retractable leashes, which can change length based on the click of a button, mean that the radius wherein a dog can go is not fixed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I don&rsquo;t mind using a retractable leash when I&rsquo;m in a wide open space with my dog, but for leash walking on a busy sidewalk, I think it defeats the major purpose of having your dog on a leash to begin with.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You want to teach your dog that he generally needs to be close to you and that he&rsquo;s allowed with in a fixed radius controlled by the leash, not by his whim.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another problem with retractable leashes is that they usually have very thin cords, which can snap or twist around dog or human body parts. Google &ldquo;Retractable Leash Injuries&rdquo; if you dare.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What&rsquo;s more, if dropped by mistake, their heavy handles can snap towards the dog, which may result in a big plastic handle hurling in the direction of your dog&rsquo;s face, which isn&rsquo;t something you want to risk when there is the possibility of your dog running into traffic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While a leash of this sort might be a nice way for a dog to have some autonomy on a rural trail, it isn&rsquo;t the best fit for city streets.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>2. CARRY TREATS</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Investing in a good treat pouch is a great way to make sure that you always have rewards on you (and don&rsquo;t end up with pockets full of grease and crumbs).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Be liberal with your dispensing of treats&mdash;you want to reward your dog whenever he pays any attention to you, whenever the leash is loose, and whenever he encounters anything that might potentially scare him.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Giving your dog a treat when he spots unusual things (or people or dogs) is a great way to help him forge positive associations with new things. Keep in mind that the treats aren&rsquo;t just for your dog&mdash;they&rsquo;re going to be for people too!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When you have a dog, you&rsquo;re not just training him to behave properly on the street&mdash;you are training people to behave properly, too. Without some coaching from you, you&rsquo;re likely to encounter people who will do a lot of improper things when greeting dogs on the street.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One way to avoid impolite interactions with people who want to say hello to your dog is to hand a treat to anyone that approaches and ask them to give it to your dog.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Your dog shouldn&rsquo;t have to sit for it or do anything for that matter. The &ldquo;trick&rdquo; they&rsquo;re being rewarded for is just the behavior of co-existing with a new human.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>3. CHOOSE YOUR WALKING PATH WISELY</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>There are a million things that could happen on a city street that could spook a dog, most of which you cannot control. The best you can do is try to guess what&rsquo;s going to be the quietest route.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If your dog is small enough and you get stuck in a particularly crowded area, pick up your pup! There is no shame in carrying your dog out of a situation where he could get stepped on.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bonus points for walking on the building side of the sidewalk, rather than by the curb.

I&rsquo;m Moving My Country Dog to the City</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Dear Ava,</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Transitioning a new dog to the city can certainly be stressful, but I do believe that, if your dog can make it in New York City, like the song says, he can make it anywhere.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In fact, some trainers refer to dogs who develop &ldquo;suburban dog syndrome&rdquo; when they&rsquo;re raised behind pPFSCbial white picket fences&mdash; these dogs can end up being easily spooked by novel things since their daily intake of new information is limited to what&rsquo;s within their yard.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even if they get a walk a day, it&rsquo;s unlikely a dog in a rural or suburban neighborhood will encounter more than a handful of new dogs, people, or stimuli in a given walk.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Compare this to the dog who grows up in a metropolitan area and may be exposed to dozens of dogs, hundreds of people, and god-only-knows what kind of stimuli on any given walk. I mean, is that guy approaching us wearing a suit made out of plastic bags and soup cans? Why yes, yes he is.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What&rsquo;s more, behaviors that might be tolerated on a leash when you have all the space in the world may not be safe or desired when you&rsquo;re on a city sidewalk.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fortunately, it&rsquo;s absolutely possible for your dog and you to learn to co-exist happily during what will be a new kind of joint outing. All you need is to focus on how you can socialize your dog to new things, and encourage the behaviors you want during walks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here are some tips on gear and training protocol that will help you both as you transition to city life.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>1. TOSS THAT RETRACTABLE LEASH</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Retractable leashes, which can change length based on the click of a button, mean that the radius wherein a dog can go is not fixed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I don&rsquo;t mind using a retractable leash when I&rsquo;m in a wide open space with my dog, but for leash walking on a busy sidewalk, I think it defeats the major purpose of having your dog on a leash to begin with.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You want to teach your dog that he generally needs to be close to you and that he&rsquo;s allowed with in a fixed radius controlled by the leash, not by his whim.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another problem with retractable leashes is that they usually have very thin cords, which can snap or twist around dog or human body parts. Google &ldquo;Retractable Leash Injuries&rdquo; if you dare.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What&rsquo;s more, if dropped by mistake, their heavy handles can snap towards the dog, which may result in a big plastic handle hurling in the direction of your dog&rsquo;s face, which isn&rsquo;t something you want to risk when there is the possibility of your dog running into traffic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While a leash of this sort might be a nice way for a dog to have some autonomy on a rural trail, it isn&rsquo;t the best fit for city streets.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>2. CARRY TREATS</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Investing in a good treat pouch is a great way to make sure that you always have rewards on you (and don&rsquo;t end up with pockets full of grease and crumbs).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Be liberal with your dispensing of treats&mdash;you want to reward your dog whenever he pays any attention to you, whenever the leash is loose, and whenever he encounters anything that might potentially scare him.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Giving your dog a treat when he spots unusual things (or people or dogs) is a great way to help him forge positive associations with new things. Keep in mind that the treats aren&rsquo;t just for your dog&mdash;they&rsquo;re going to be for people too!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When you have a dog, you&rsquo;re not just training him to behave properly on the street&mdash;you are training people to behave properly, too. Without some coaching from you, you&rsquo;re likely to encounter people who will do a lot of improper things when greeting dogs on the street.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One way to avoid impolite interactions with people who want to say hello to your dog is to hand a treat to anyone that approaches and ask them to give it to your dog.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Your dog shouldn&rsquo;t have to sit for it or do anything for that matter.

I&rsquo;m Moving My Country Dog to the City</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Dear Ava,</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Transitioning a new dog to the city can certainly be stressful, but I do believe that, if your dog can make it in New York City, like the song says, he can make it anywhere.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In fact, some trainers refer to dogs who develop &ldquo;suburban dog syndrome&rdquo; when they&rsquo;re raised behind pPFSCbial white picket fences&mdash; these dogs can end up being easily spooked by novel things since their daily intake of new information is limited to what&rsquo;s within their yard.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even if they get a walk a day, it&rsquo;s unlikely a dog in a rural or suburban neighborhood will encounter more than a handful of new dogs, people, or stimuli in a given walk.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Compare this to the dog who grows up in a metropolitan area and may be exposed to dozens of dogs, hundreds of people, and god-only-knows what kind of stimuli on any given walk. I mean, is that guy approaching us wearing a suit made out of plastic bags and soup cans? Why yes, yes he is.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What&rsquo;s more, behaviors that might be tolerated on a leash when you have all the space in the world may not be safe or desired when you&rsquo;re on a city sidewalk.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fortunately, it&rsquo;s absolutely possible for your dog and you to learn to co-exist happily during what will be a new kind of joint outing. All you need is to focus on how you can socialize your dog to new things, and encourage the behaviors you want during walks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here are some tips on gear and training protocol that will help you both as you transition to city life.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>1. TOSS THAT RETRACTABLE LEASH</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Retractable leashes, which can change length based on the click of a button, mean that the radius wherein a dog can go is not fixed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I don&rsquo;t mind using a retractable leash when I&rsquo;m in a wide open space with my dog, but for leash walking on a busy sidewalk, I think it defeats the major purpose of having your dog on a leash to begin with.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You want to teach your dog that he generally needs to be close to you and that he&rsquo;s allowed with in a fixed radius controlled by the leash, not by his whim.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another problem with retractable leashes is that they usually have very thin cords, which can snap or twist around dog or human body parts. Google &ldquo;Retractable Leash Injuries&rdquo; if you dare.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What&rsquo;s more, if dropped by mistake, their heavy handles can snap towards the dog, which may result in a big plastic handle hurling in the direction of your dog&rsquo;s face, which isn&rsquo;t something you want to risk when there is the possibility of your dog running into traffic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While a leash of this sort might be a nice way for a dog to have some autonomy on a rural trail, it isn&rsquo;t the best fit for city streets.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>2. CARRY TREATS</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Investing in a good treat pouch is a great way to make sure that you always have rewards on you (and don&rsquo;t end up with pockets full of grease and crumbs).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Be liberal with your dispensing of treats&mdash;you want to reward your dog whenever he pays any attention to you, whenever the leash is loose, and whenever he encounters anything that might potentially scare him.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Giving your dog a treat when he spots unusual things (or people or dogs) is a great way to help him forge positive associations with new things. Keep in mind that the treats aren&rsquo;t just for your dog&mdash;they&rsquo;re going to be for people too!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When you have a dog, you&rsquo;re not just training him to behave properly on the street&mdash;you are training people to behave properly, too. Without some coaching from you, you&rsquo;re likely to encounter people who will do a lot of improper things when greeting dogs on the street.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One way to avoid impolite interactions with people who want to say hello to your dog is to hand a treat to anyone that approaches and ask them to give it to your dog.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Your dog shouldn&rsquo;t have to sit for it or do anything for that matter. The &ldquo;trick&rdquo; they&rsquo;re being rewarded for is just the behavior of co-existing with a new human.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>3. CHOOSE YOUR WALKING PATH WISELY</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>There are a million things that could happen on a city street that could spook a dog, most of which you cannot control. The best you can do is try to guess what&rsquo;s going to be the quietest route.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If your dog is small enough and you get stuck in a particularly crowded area, pick up your pup!

Without some coaching from you, you&rsquo;re likely to encounter people who will do a lot of improper things when greeting dogs on the street.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One way to avoid impolite interactions with people who want to say hello to your dog is to hand a treat to anyone that approaches and ask them to give it to your dog.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Your dog shouldn&rsquo;t have to sit for it or do anything for that matter. The &ldquo;trick&rdquo; they&rsquo;re being rewarded for is just the behavior of co-existing with a new human.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>3. CHOOSE YOUR WALKING PATH WISELY</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>There are a million things that could happen on a city street that could spook a dog, most of which you cannot control. The best you can do is try to guess what&rsquo;s going to be the quietest route.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If your dog is small enough and you get stuck in a particularly crowded area, pick up your pup! There is no shame in carrying your dog out of a situation where he could get stepped on.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bonus points for walking on the building side of the sidewalk, rather than by the curb. If your dog does get loose, that extra two or three feet will mean a little bit more of a buffer area where you might be able to grab him before he enters traffic.</p>\r\n', '8c7bbbba95c1025975e548cee86dfadc_1579610935_3126.jpg', NULL, NULL, '2020-01-21 17:48:55');

Company&#39;s reserves the right to change products and specifications and those listed on the Site may not be current. Customer agrees to verify the specifications of each product with the order.

Any additional provisions to your purchase must be made in writing signed by an officer of Company&#39;s.</li>\r\n	<li>Customer agrees that each item in a multi-item purchase from Company&#39;s shall be treated independently unless stated otherwise in the memo section of their order. That is, defect, replacement, and cancellation of one item does not constitute the voiding of the entire purchase. Each item shall be considered independently for warranty or refund purposes unless the customer has stated otherwise in the invoice memo.</li>\r\n	<li>Customer agrees that shipping costs and expenses will not be refunded once we ship.</li>\r\n	<li>It is the Customer&#39;s responsibility to look over their email confirmation and make sure all shipping, billing and item purchased are correct. If you do not get an email confirmation, call us to see if the order went through. Do not submit multiple orders or you will end up paying full restocking and shipping fees.</li>\r\n	<li>Order cancellation will be accepted by phone with a sales representative or over the web (only before the order is processed). It cannot be done over email or by leaving voice mails. You can confirm order cancellation by checking the order status online. Cancellation on orders already charged carries a 4.9% credit card processing cancellation fee. If an order has already been built in our facility (entered Stage 4) but has not been shipped, there will be an additional 15% restocking fee which covers expenses for taking the system apart and re-stocking the hardware.</li>\r\n	<li>Material fee for boxes, transportation, etc. are included in the shipping fee.

WEB ORDERING SECURITY</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Protecting your information is a priority for us. We use 128-bit encryption Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology to protect the security of your online order information. When you are about to enter your credit card information, look at the bottom right corner of the browser window for a icon of a gold lock. Also you can look at your address bar and see if it starts with &ldquo;https://&rdquo;. Some versions of browsers and some firewalls don&#39;t permit connection through secure servers. In that case, you won&#39;t be able to connect to the server and therefore won&#39;t be able to place an order through an insecure connection. If you cannot access the secure server for any reason, Please contact us to place an order, 1-866-81-STORM.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>B. TRADEMARKS</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>All trademarks and registered trademarks displayed on the site are the trademarks of their respective owners, and are not intended to imply any endorsement or affiliation between Company&#39;s and these companies.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>C. MAKING PURCHASES</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>If you wish to purchase products offered on the site, you will be asked to supply certain information, including but not limited to credit card or other payment information. You agree that all information you provide to Company&#39;s will be accurate complete and current. You agree to pay all charges incurred by authorized users of your account and credit card or other payment mechanism at the prices in effect when such charges are incurred. You will also be responsible for paying any applicable taxes, and shipping and handling charges relating to your purchases.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>D. WHERE WE SHIP</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>We ship to any physical address that the shipper/courier can ship to domestically or internationally. We may accommodate (&ldquo;Customer&rdquo;) who need to have an item shipped to an APO/FPO address or PO Box depending on the circumstances. Due to the number of wrong addresses from customers, we now charge the face value that the shipper/courier charges us to reroute your package if you did not enter the address correctly. This charge is anywhere from $5-$25 and you agree if your address is wrong, Company&#39;s is authorized to charge your credit card for these fees.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>E. WHEN WE SHIP</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Orders received before 3:00 PM PST are usually processed the same day for product build. Products are shipped only after build which can take up to 15 days on a standard basis. Your order may be delayed if your ship to address does not match what your credit card issuer has on their file. Some orders that are shipped from fulfillment warehouses may require longer for the item to ship. We may also ship the orders with multiple items from different warehouses so it is possible you get the items on different days. Due to the many circumstances such as unable to charge your card or verify your address, we cannot guarantee when your order is shipped out. Also if you choose next day air service, it does not necessarily mean you will get it the next day from the order date, it means that you will get it the next day from the date we ship the order. Company&#39;s reserves the right at any time after receipt of your order to delay your order for any reason.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>F. SHIPPING DELAYS</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Once an order is shipped, it is up to the shipper courier to deliver the products; we will not be able to stop the shipment once it is shipped. If the shipper/courier loses the package, the shipper courier will put a tracer on the package. Tracers take around 3 days for air packages and 7 business days for ground packages. We will not be able to ship out replacement packages until the shipper courier confirms that the package is lost/will not be delivered to its destination and they will reimburse us. Without confirmation from the shipper courier, we will not know for sure if you will get two shipments if we ship out another one. Another delay is if there is no one to sign for the package, every package we ship usually requires a signature, if a package is returned to us because no one was available to sign for it or the address was input incorrectly at the time you enter the order, you will be charged again to ship it out a second time.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>G. PRICING AND TYPOGRAPHICAL ERRORS</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Due to the fast pace of the computer industry, all prices are subject to change without notice. We make every effort to list the most accurate, up to the minute information. Despite our efforts, some items on our website may be miss-priced. If a product is listed at an incorrect price due to a typographical, photographical, or technical error or error in pricing from our vendors, Company&#39;s reserves the right to refuse or cancel any orders placed for a product listed at the incorrect price. If your credit card has already been charged for the incorrect price, we will immediately refund your card and cancel your order. You may also repurchase it for the correct price if you wish to. Due to the volatility in pricing for computer products, we do not match competitor&#39;s pricing and we will not offer price protection beyond the 24 hours of purchase. Example: If Intel drops the price of a processor 5 days after your purchase, that is beyond our control and our cost for that same processor when we shipped is also much higher than our current selling price. We will not be able to refund the difference since we had to purchase the processor at a much higher cost to send it to you when you placed your order.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>H. ORDER ACCEPTANCE POLICY</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Your receipt of an electronic or phone order confirmation does not signify our acceptance of your order. Company&#39;s reserves the right at any time after receipt of your order to accept or decline your order for any reason.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>I.

The returned merchandise must include its original packaging, manuals, and all accessories. All sales on software items are final. Opened accessories such as the monitor and speakers will not be refunded. Company&#39;s will not refund shipping costs and will not pay shipping for returning packages. ORIGINAL SALES RECEIPT REQUIRED FOR ALL RETURNS.

Before making any return, back up all software and data and remove any personal information, confidential information or private content which you do not want viewed or used by any third party. Company&#39;s is not liable for lost data or misuse of data on computers that are returned for any reason.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>M. WARRANTY SERVICE</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Company&#39;s warrants to the original purchaser that any hardware part of the computer system, excluding accessories (display monitor, keyboard, mouse, software, operating system, documentation and similar items) will be free of defects in workmanship and materials for the period the warranty included with the purchase from the date of delivery to Customer. During the warranty period, Company&#39;s will repair or replace, at its sole discretion, the defective computer system, for defects specified by you, free of charge for labor and/or parts depending on your warranty period. Parts may not be the same but will be equivalent parts. Company&#39;s will cover shipping costs back and forth and replace the part(s) within the first 60 days of receiving your computer system. After 60 days you will be held liable for shipping costs to Company&#39;s and Company&#39;s will cover return shipping back to you. The remedy for this breach of warranty is limited to replacement or repair with parts warranted for the the remainder of the warranty period. Any additional purchases or upgrades will not extend this warranty. Excluded from this warranty is any damage caused during shipment (except the shipment to the original purchaser) and any damage caused by: impacts, fluids, fire, flood, wind, earthquake, lightning or similar disaster; unauthorized modifications, attachments or peripherals, improper use, environment, installation or electrical supply; improper maintenance; any other misuse, abuse, or mishandling. Company&#39;s&#39;s sole liability, under this warranty, for failure to repair or replace the hardware system after a reasonable number of attempts is limited to replacement or, at Company&#39;s&#39;s sole discretion, refund of the original purchase price. The above constitutes purchaser&#39;s exclusive remedies for breach of warranty. Company&#39;s shall, under no circumstances, be liable for any other damages, including but not limited to special, incidental, consequential and other similar claims whether based upon breach of contract, breach of warranty, negligence, or strict liability, or any other similar theories. Damages excluded include but are not limited to: loss of profit, loss of revenue, loss of data or software, loss of use of the hardware system, loss of use of related equipment, cost of substitute or replacement equipment, &quot;down-time&quot;, purchaser&rsquo;s time, injury to property, and all claims of third parties. EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY STATED HEREIN, Company&#39;s MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, OF ANY KIND WITH RESPECT TO PRODUCTS SOLD BY Company&#39;s. EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY STATED HEREIN, Company&#39;s. EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, OF ANY KIND WITH RESPECT TO PRODUCTS SOLD ON THIS SITE, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Depending on the term of the limited warranty, the coverage of labor and parts will vary. For additional details, please visit the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://localhost/herosolutions/infosky/terms-and-conditions.php?\">warranty details page</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>N. REFUSED SHIPMENTS</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Any product that Company&#39;s ships out to Customer comes back to Company&#39;s as refused delivery, Customer will subject to fees. A restock fee of 15% will be applied to computer system. Also, shipping fees sending the package to the Customer and receiving the package back from the Customer will not be refunded.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>O. CURRENT MARKET VALUE</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Since every computer system is customized to the Customer&rsquo;s needs, it becomes difficult to return computer systems for a full refund. If you are having defective parts issues with the computer system, we will be more than happy to offer a full refund, minus shipping costs for the purchase price of the computer at its current market value. For example, if you purchased a system from Company&#39;s at the price of $1,500.00 after a length of time, you are requesting a full refund (and you have a verified defective hardware component such as a memory stick, etc causing stability/performance issues within the first 30-days of original delivery) we will offer a full refund for the hardware at its current selling market value. If the same system is now available for $1,200.00, Company&#39;s will issue a refund of $1,200.00 which will allow you to still purchase a computer with the same configuration that you originally ordered at $1,500.00. This protects the customer and Company&#39;s from price adjustments from manufacturers that are out of both Company&#39;s and the customer&rsquo;s control. In the end, the customer will still be able to buy a new computer with the same specifications from the original purchase.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>P. SPECIAL REQUESTED COMPONENTS &amp; ACCESSORIES</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Customers are more than welcome to request Company&#39;s to purchase components or accessories that we normally do not offer and stock for customers to purchase on our website. In the event of an order cancellation, such items cannot be returned to Company&#39;s for a refund under any circumstances once they have been ordered, they will be returned back to the customer at the customer&rsquo;s expense. In addition, if any special ordered components or accessories turn out to be defective during testing at Company&#39;s or after the customer receives the end product, it will be the responsibility of the customer, not Company&#39;s to obtain replacement warranty service directly from the manufacturer.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Q. INTERNATIONAL CUSTOMERS</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The Terms and Conditions and Warranty also applies to Company&#39;s products shipped to any location outside of the Continental United States, the customer is responsible for paying all freight charges incurred in shipping, importing/exporting, receiving replacement parts and for arranging and paying for the shipment of any defective part(s) back to Company&#39;s. All international customers are responsible for all customs duties, VAT and other associated taxes and charges. Such import custom, duty, VAT and other taxes and charges are non-refundable once the order ships.</p>\r\n'),

MAKING PURCHASES</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>If you wish to purchase products offered on the site, you will be asked to supply certain information, including but not limited to credit card or other payment information. You agree that all information you provide to Company&#39;s will be accurate complete and current.

WHERE WE SHIP</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>We ship to any physical address that the shipper/courier can ship to domestically or internationally. We may accommodate (&ldquo;Customer&rdquo;) who need to have an item shipped to an APO/FPO address or PO Box depending on the circumstances. Due to the number of wrong addresses from customers, we now charge the face value that the shipper/courier charges us to reroute your package if you did not enter the address correctly. This charge is anywhere from $5-$25 and you agree if your address is wrong, Company&#39;s is authorized to charge your credit card for these fees.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>E. WHEN WE SHIP</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Orders received before 3:00 PM PST are usually processed the same day for product build. Products are shipped only after build which can take up to 15 days on a standard basis. Your order may be delayed if your ship to address does not match what your credit card issuer has on their file. Some orders that are shipped from fulfillment warehouses may require longer for the item to ship. We may also ship the orders with multiple items from different warehouses so it is possible you get the items on different days. Due to the many circumstances such as unable to charge your card or verify your address, we cannot guarantee when your order is shipped out. Also if you choose next day air service, it does not necessarily mean you will get it the next day from the order date, it means that you will get it the next day from the date we ship the order.
