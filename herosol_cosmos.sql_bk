I&rsquo;m Moving My Country Dog to the City</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Dear Ava,</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Transitioning a new dog to the city can certainly be stressful, but I do believe that, if your dog can make it in New York City, like the song says, he can make it anywhere.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In fact, some trainers refer to dogs who develop &ldquo;suburban dog syndrome&rdquo; when they&rsquo;re raised behind pPFSCbial white picket fences&mdash; these dogs can end up being easily spooked by novel things since their daily intake of new information is limited to what&rsquo;s within their yard.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even if they get a walk a day, it&rsquo;s unlikely a dog in a rural or suburban neighborhood will encounter more than a handful of new dogs, people, or stimuli in a given walk.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Compare this to the dog who grows up in a metropolitan area and may be exposed to dozens of dogs, hundreds of people, and god-only-knows what kind of stimuli on any given walk. I mean, is that guy approaching us wearing a suit made out of plastic bags and soup cans? Why yes, yes he is.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What&rsquo;s more, behaviors that might be tolerated on a leash when you have all the space in the world may not be safe or desired when you&rsquo;re on a city sidewalk.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fortunately, it&rsquo;s absolutely possible for your dog and you to learn to co-exist happily during what will be a new kind of joint outing. All you need is to focus on how you can socialize your dog to new things, and encourage the behaviors you want during walks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here are some tips on gear and training protocol that will help you both as you transition to city life.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>1. TOSS THAT RETRACTABLE LEASH</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Retractable leashes, which can change length based on the click of a button, mean that the radius wherein a dog can go is not fixed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I don&rsquo;t mind using a retractable leash when I&rsquo;m in a wide open space with my dog, but for leash walking on a busy sidewalk, I think it defeats the major purpose of having your dog on a leash to begin with.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You want to teach your dog that he generally needs to be close to you and that he&rsquo;s allowed with in a fixed radius controlled by the leash, not by his whim.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another problem with retractable leashes is that they usually have very thin cords, which can snap or twist around dog or human body parts. Google &ldquo;Retractable Leash Injuries&rdquo; if you dare.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What&rsquo;s more, if dropped by mistake, their heavy handles can snap towards the dog, which may result in a big plastic handle hurling in the direction of your dog&rsquo;s face, which isn&rsquo;t something you want to risk when there is the possibility of your dog running into traffic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While a leash of this sort might be a nice way for a dog to have some autonomy on a rural trail, it isn&rsquo;t the best fit for city streets.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>2. CARRY TREATS</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Investing in a good treat pouch is a great way to make sure that you always have rewards on you (and don&rsquo;t end up with pockets full of grease and crumbs).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Be liberal with your dispensing of treats&mdash;you want to reward your dog whenever he pays any attention to you, whenever the leash is loose, and whenever he encounters anything that might potentially scare him.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Giving your dog a treat when he spots unusual things (or people or dogs) is a great way to help him forge positive associations with new things. Keep in mind that the treats aren&rsquo;t just for your dog&mdash;they&rsquo;re going to be for people too!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When you have a dog, you&rsquo;re not just training him to behave properly on the street&mdash;you are training people to behave properly, too. Without some coaching from you, you&rsquo;re likely to encounter people who will do a lot of improper things when greeting dogs on the street.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One way to avoid impolite interactions with people who want to say hello to your dog is to hand a treat to anyone that approaches and ask them to give it to your dog.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Your dog shouldn&rsquo;t have to sit for it or do anything for that matter. The &ldquo;trick&rdquo; they&rsquo;re being rewarded for is just the behavior of co-existing with a new human.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>3. CHOOSE YOUR WALKING PATH WISELY</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>There are a million things that could happen on a city street that could spook a dog, most of which you cannot control. The best you can do is try to guess what&rsquo;s going to be the quietest route.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If your dog is small enough and you get stuck in a particularly crowded area, pick up your pup! There is no shame in carrying your dog out of a situation where he could get stepped on.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bonus points for walking on the building side of the sidewalk, rather than by the curb. If your dog does get loose, that extra two or three feet will mean a little bit more of a buffer area where you might be able to grab him before he enters traffic.</p>\r\n', '140f6969d5213fd0ece03148e62e461e_1579610138_6524.jpg', 'dfasfd', 'dsfadsf', '2020-01-21 17:35:38'),

I&rsquo;m Moving My Country Dog to the City</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Dear Ava,</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Transitioning a new dog to the city can certainly be stressful, but I do believe that, if your dog can make it in New York City, like the song says, he can make it anywhere.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In fact, some trainers refer to dogs who develop &ldquo;suburban dog syndrome&rdquo; when they&rsquo;re raised behind pPFSCbial white picket fences&mdash; these dogs can end up being easily spooked by novel things since their daily intake of new information is limited to what&rsquo;s within their yard.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even if they get a walk a day, it&rsquo;s unlikely a dog in a rural or suburban neighborhood will encounter more than a handful of new dogs, people, or stimuli in a given walk.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Compare this to the dog who grows up in a metropolitan area and may be exposed to dozens of dogs, hundreds of people, and god-only-knows what kind of stimuli on any given walk. I mean, is that guy approaching us wearing a suit made out of plastic bags and soup cans? Why yes, yes he is.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What&rsquo;s more, behaviors that might be tolerated on a leash when you have all the space in the world may not be safe or desired when you&rsquo;re on a city sidewalk.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fortunately, it&rsquo;s absolutely possible for your dog and you to learn to co-exist happily during what will be a new kind of joint outing. All you need is to focus on how you can socialize your dog to new things, and encourage the behaviors you want during walks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here are some tips on gear and training protocol that will help you both as you transition to city life.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>1. TOSS THAT RETRACTABLE LEASH</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Retractable leashes, which can change length based on the click of a button, mean that the radius wherein a dog can go is not fixed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I don&rsquo;t mind using a retractable leash when I&rsquo;m in a wide open space with my dog, but for leash walking on a busy sidewalk, I think it defeats the major purpose of having your dog on a leash to begin with.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You want to teach your dog that he generally needs to be close to you and that he&rsquo;s allowed with in a fixed radius controlled by the leash, not by his whim.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another problem with retractable leashes is that they usually have very thin cords, which can snap or twist around dog or human body parts. Google &ldquo;Retractable Leash Injuries&rdquo; if you dare.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What&rsquo;s more, if dropped by mistake, their heavy handles can snap towards the dog, which may result in a big plastic handle hurling in the direction of your dog&rsquo;s face, which isn&rsquo;t something you want to risk when there is the possibility of your dog running into traffic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While a leash of this sort might be a nice way for a dog to have some autonomy on a rural trail, it isn&rsquo;t the best fit for city streets.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>2.

No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure.

I&rsquo;m Moving My Country Dog to the City</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Dear Ava,</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Transitioning a new dog to the city can certainly be stressful, but I do believe that, if your dog can make it in New York City, like the song says, he can make it anywhere.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In fact, some trainers refer to dogs who develop &ldquo;suburban dog syndrome&rdquo; when they&rsquo;re raised behind pPFSCbial white picket fences&mdash; these dogs can end up being easily spooked by novel things since their daily intake of new information is limited to what&rsquo;s within their yard.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even if they get a walk a day, it&rsquo;s unlikely a dog in a rural or suburban neighborhood will encounter more than a handful of new dogs, people, or stimuli in a given walk.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Compare this to the dog who grows up in a metropolitan area and may be exposed to dozens of dogs, hundreds of people, and god-only-knows what kind of stimuli on any given walk. I mean, is that guy approaching us wearing a suit made out of plastic bags and soup cans? Why yes, yes he is.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What&rsquo;s more, behaviors that might be tolerated on a leash when you have all the space in the world may not be safe or desired when you&rsquo;re on a city sidewalk.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fortunately, it&rsquo;s absolutely possible for your dog and you to learn to co-exist happily during what will be a new kind of joint outing. All you need is to focus on how you can socialize your dog to new things, and encourage the behaviors you want during walks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here are some tips on gear and training protocol that will help you both as you transition to city life.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>1. TOSS THAT RETRACTABLE LEASH</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Retractable leashes, which can change length based on the click of a button, mean that the radius wherein a dog can go is not fixed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I don&rsquo;t mind using a retractable leash when I&rsquo;m in a wide open space with my dog, but for leash walking on a busy sidewalk, I think it defeats the major purpose of having your dog on a leash to begin with.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You want to teach your dog that he generally needs to be close to you and that he&rsquo;s allowed with in a fixed radius controlled by the leash, not by his whim.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another problem with retractable leashes is that they usually have very thin cords, which can snap or twist around dog or human body parts. Google &ldquo;Retractable Leash Injuries&rdquo; if you dare.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What&rsquo;s more, if dropped by mistake, their heavy handles can snap towards the dog, which may result in a big plastic handle hurling in the direction of your dog&rsquo;s face, which isn&rsquo;t something you want to risk when there is the possibility of your dog running into traffic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While a leash of this sort might be a nice way for a dog to have some autonomy on a rural trail, it isn&rsquo;t the best fit for city streets.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>2. CARRY TREATS</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Investing in a good treat pouch is a great way to make sure that you always have rewards on you (and don&rsquo;t end up with pockets full of grease and crumbs).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Be liberal with your dispensing of treats&mdash;you want to reward your dog whenever he pays any attention to you, whenever the leash is loose, and whenever he encounters anything that might potentially scare him.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Giving your dog a treat when he spots unusual things (or people or dogs) is a great way to help him forge positive associations with new things. Keep in mind that the treats aren&rsquo;t just for your dog&mdash;they&rsquo;re going to be for people too!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When you have a dog, you&rsquo;re not just training him to behave properly on the street&mdash;you are training people to behave properly, too. Without some coaching from you, you&rsquo;re likely to encounter people who will do a lot of improper things when greeting dogs on the street.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One way to avoid impolite interactions with people who want to say hello to your dog is to hand a treat to anyone that approaches and ask them to give it to your dog.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Your dog shouldn&rsquo;t have to sit for it or do anything for that matter. The &ldquo;trick&rdquo; they&rsquo;re being rewarded for is just the behavior of co-existing with a new human.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>3. CHOOSE YOUR WALKING PATH WISELY</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>There are a million things that could happen on a city street that could spook a dog, most of which you cannot control. The best you can do is try to guess what&rsquo;s going to be the quietest route.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If your dog is small enough and you get stuck in a particularly crowded area, pick up your pup! There is no shame in carrying your dog out of a situation where he could get stepped on.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bonus points for walking on the building side of the sidewalk, rather than by the curb. If your dog does get loose, that extra two or three feet will mean a little bit more of a buffer area where you might be able to grab him before he enters traffic.</p>\r\n', '210f760a89db30aa72ca258a3483cc7f_1579616145_2448.jpg', 'qewr', 'ewr', '2020-01-21 17:35:38'),

I&rsquo;m Moving My Country Dog to the City</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Dear Ava,</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Transitioning a new dog to the city can certainly be stressful, but I do believe that, if your dog can make it in New York City, like the song says, he can make it anywhere.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In fact, some trainers refer to dogs who develop &ldquo;suburban dog syndrome&rdquo; when they&rsquo;re raised behind pPFSCbial white picket fences&mdash; these dogs can end up being easily spooked by novel things since their daily intake of new information is limited to what&rsquo;s within their yard.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even if they get a walk a day, it&rsquo;s unlikely a dog in a rural or suburban neighborhood will encounter more than a handful of new dogs, people, or stimuli in a given walk.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Compare this to the dog who grows up in a metropolitan area and may be exposed to dozens of dogs, hundreds of people, and god-only-knows what kind of stimuli on any given walk. I mean, is that guy approaching us wearing a suit made out of plastic bags and soup cans? Why yes, yes he is.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What&rsquo;s more, behaviors that might be tolerated on a leash when you have all the space in the world may not be safe or desired when you&rsquo;re on a city sidewalk.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fortunately, it&rsquo;s absolutely possible for your dog and you to learn to co-exist happily during what will be a new kind of joint outing. All you need is to focus on how you can socialize your dog to new things, and encourage the behaviors you want during walks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here are some tips on gear and training protocol that will help you both as you transition to city life.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>1. TOSS THAT RETRACTABLE LEASH</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Retractable leashes, which can change length based on the click of a button, mean that the radius wherein a dog can go is not fixed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I don&rsquo;t mind using a retractable leash when I&rsquo;m in a wide open space with my dog, but for leash walking on a busy sidewalk, I think it defeats the major purpose of having your dog on a leash to begin with.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You want to teach your dog that he generally needs to be close to you and that he&rsquo;s allowed with in a fixed radius controlled by the leash, not by his whim.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another problem with retractable leashes is that they usually have very thin cords, which can snap or twist around dog or human body parts. Google &ldquo;Retractable Leash Injuries&rdquo; if you dare.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What&rsquo;s more, if dropped by mistake, their heavy handles can snap towards the dog, which may result in a big plastic handle hurling in the direction of your dog&rsquo;s face, which isn&rsquo;t something you want to risk when there is the possibility of your dog running into traffic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While a leash of this sort might be a nice way for a dog to have some autonomy on a rural trail, it isn&rsquo;t the best fit for city streets.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>2. CARRY TREATS</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Investing in a good treat pouch is a great way to make sure that you always have rewards on you (and don&rsquo;t end up with pockets full of grease and crumbs).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Be liberal with your dispensing of treats&mdash;you want to reward your dog whenever he pays any attention to you, whenever the leash is loose, and whenever he encounters anything that might potentially scare him.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Giving your dog a treat when he spots unusual things (or people or dogs) is a great way to help him forge positive associations with new things. Keep in mind that the treats aren&rsquo;t just for your dog&mdash;they&rsquo;re going to be for people too!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When you have a dog, you&rsquo;re not just training him to behave properly on the street&mdash;you are training people to behave properly, too. Without some coaching from you, you&rsquo;re likely to encounter people who will do a lot of improper things when greeting dogs on the street.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One way to avoid impolite interactions with people who want to say hello to your dog is to hand a treat to anyone that approaches and ask them to give it to your dog.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Your dog shouldn&rsquo;t have to sit for it or do anything for that matter. The &ldquo;trick&rdquo; they&rsquo;re being rewarded for is just the behavior of co-existing with a new human.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>3. CHOOSE YOUR WALKING PATH WISELY</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>There are a million things that could happen on a city street that could spook a dog, most of which you cannot control. The best you can do is try to guess what&rsquo;s going to be the quietest route.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If your dog is small enough and you get stuck in a particularly crowded area, pick up your pup! There is no shame in carrying your dog out of a situation where he could get stepped on.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bonus points for walking on the building side of the sidewalk, rather than by the curb. If your dog does get loose, that extra two or three feet will mean a little bit more of a buffer area where you might be able to grab him before he enters traffic.</p>\r\n', '140f6969d5213fd0ece03148e62e461e_1579610138_6524.jpg', NULL, NULL, '2020-01-21 17:35:38'),

The Terms govern your use of our software applications, resources and services for pet owners and pet service providers to find each other, communicate with each other, and arrange for the provision of pet care services (collectively, our &ldquo;PFSC Service&rdquo;). The Terms govern all use of the PFSC Service, whether you access it from our website at https://www.pfsc.com (or any localized version) (the &ldquo;Site&rdquo;), our mobile applications and mobile websites, our Facebook application, our online or phone support offerings, or any other access point we make available to you. Our&nbsp;<a href="https://herosolutions.com.pk/sarim/pfsc/guarantee" target="_blank">PFSC Guarantee Terms</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://herosolutions.com.pk/sarim/pfsc/reservation-protection" target="_blank">Booking Protection Policy</a>&nbsp;and other Policies applicable to your use of the PFSC Service are incorporated by reference into these Terms of Service. BY AGREEING TO THESE TERMS DURING THE ACCOUNT SIGN-UP PROCESS OR ACCESSING OR USING THE PFSC SERVICE WITHOUT AN ACCOUNT, YOU ACCEPT THESE TERMS. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH THESE TERMS, YOU SHOULD NOT ACCEPT THEM, IN WHICH CASE YOU DO NOT HAVE THE RIGHT TO USE THE PFSC SERVICE.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You understand and agree that we may change the Terms from time to time, and that any such changes will be effective (except as otherwise described in Section 17.10 below) when we post the modified Terms on the PFSC Service, unless otherwise required by applicable law. Your continued access and use of the PFSC Service after we post the modified Terms will constitute your consent to be bound by the modified Terms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2. PFSC Service.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2.1 Nature of the PFSC Service.</strong> The PFSC Service consists of a desktop Web application, mobile applications, and other related tools, support and services that pet owners (&ldquo;Pet Owners&rdquo;) and providers of pet-related services (&ldquo;Service Providers&rdquo;) can use to find, communicate with and interact with each other. The PFSC Service includes our emergency support services, educational materials for Service Providers, and other services. We charge fees for some aspects of the PFSC Service, as described below in Section 9.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2.2 PFSC does not provide Pet Care Services.</strong> PFSC is a neutral venue for Service Providers and Pet Owners. PFSC is not a Service Provider and, except for emergency phone support and other resources and support specifically described in the PFSC Service, does not provide pet care services. We make no representations or warranties about the quality of boarding, pet sitting, dog walking, house sitting, or other services provided by Service Providers (&ldquo;Pet Care Services&rdquo;), or about your interactions and dealings with users. Service Providers listed on PFSC are not under the direction or control of PFSC, and Service Providers determine in their own discretion how to provide Pet Care Services. Though we provide general guidance on our Site to Service Providers about safety and pet care and to Pet Owners about selecting and engaging Service Providers, PFSC does not employ, recommend or endorse Service Providers or Pet Owners, and, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, we will not be responsible or liable for the performance or conduct of Service Providers or Pet Owners, whether online or offline. We conduct an initial review of Service Provider profiles and we facilitate Background Checks or Identification Verifications (each as described in Section 10, below) on Service Providers conducted by a third party, but, except where explicitly specified in the PFSC Service (and then only to the extent specified), do not otherwise screen Service Providers or Pet Owners. You should exercise caution and use your independent judgment before engaging a Service Provider, providing Pet Care Services, or otherwise interacting with users via the PFSC Service. Pet Owners and Service Providers are solely responsible for making decisions that are in the best interests of themselves and their pets. For example, each user of the PFSC Service is responsible for keeping current his or her own pet&rsquo;s vaccinations, and we will have no liability for anyone&rsquo;s failure to vaccinate his or her pet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2.3 Release.</strong>&nbsp;Subject to Section 16 below, our liability for any claims, injuries, loss, harm and/or damages arising from and/or in any way related to your interactions or dealings with other users and the acts and/or omissions of Service Providers and Pet Owners, whether online or offline, is limited to the amounts and obligations set forth in the PFSC Guarantee.&nbsp;You acknowledge and agree that, except to the extent we have liability under the PFSC Guarantee, and to the maximum extent permitted by the applicable law, YOUR USE AND/OR PROVISION OF PET CARE SERVICES IS AT YOUR SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE RISK.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2.4 Transactions are between Pet Owners and Service Providers.</strong> The PFSC Service may be used to find and offer Pet Care Services and to facilitate payment, but all transactions conducted via the PFSC Service are between Pet Owners and Service Providers. Except for the limited refunds and &ldquo;Booking Protection&rdquo; specified in Section 9.6 and the PFSC Guarantee, you agree that PFSC has no liability for damages associated with Pet Care Services (which may include bodily injury to, or death of, a pet) or resulting from any other transactions between users of the PFSC Service.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2.5 Bookings.</strong> Pet Owners and Service Providers transact with each other on the PFSC Service when they both agree to a &ldquo;booking&rdquo; that specifies the fees, time period, cancellation policy, and other terms for provision of Pet Care Services via the booking mechanism provided on the PFSC Service (a &ldquo;Booking&rdquo;). A Booking may be initiated by either a Service Provider or a Pet Owner by selecting the type(s) of Pet Care Services to be provided and then following the prompts that appear on-screen. If you are a Pet Owner and you initiate a Booking, you agree to pay for the Pet Care Services described in the Booking when you click &ldquo;Request &amp; Pay.&rdquo; If you are a Pet Owner and a Service Provider initiates a Booking, you agree to pay for the Pet Care Services described in the Booking when you click &ldquo;Pay Now.&rdquo; All requests are subject to acceptance by the receiving party. The receiving party is not obligated to accept your (or any) request and may, at their discretion, decline for any reason. You acknowledge that, once you complete a Booking, you agree to honor the price and other terms of that Booking, as acknowledged in the Booking confirmation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2.6 Pet Owners are Solely Responsible for Evaluating Service Providers.</strong> Pet Owners are solely responsible for evaluating the suitability of Service Providers for the services they offer to provide. Please visit the&nbsp;<a href="https://herosolutions.com.pk/sarim/pfsc/help" target="_blank">Help Center</a>&nbsp;for guidance about making informed decisions about engaging Service Providers. Though PFSC performs a limited review of Service Provider profiles and facilitates Service Provider Background Checks or Identity Verifications conducted by a third party, any such screening is limited, and PFSC does not warrant that any such screen is accurate, complete, conclusive or up-to-date. Similarly, PFSC does not endorse reviews of Service Providers by other Pet Owners that may be available via the PFSC Service, and PFSC makes no commitments that such reviews are accurate or legitimate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2.7 Abandoned Pets; Re-homing.</strong> Pet Owners who arrange for Pet Care Services and fail to retrieve their pet after the service period identified in a Booking agree that PFSC (or the Service Provider) may, in its (or his or her) sole discretion, place the pet in foster care, transfer care to animal control or other law enforcement authorities, or find other alternate care. Pet Owner agrees to reimburse PFSC and/or the Service Provider for all costs and expenses associated with such actions. Further, PFSC expressly reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to remove a Pet Owner&rsquo;s pet from a Service Provider&rsquo;s care should PFSC deem it necessary for the safety of a pet, the Service Provider, or any persons living with the Service Provider. Prior to removing a pet from the care of a Service Provider, PFSC will use reasonable efforts during its normal business hours to contact the Pet Owner and/or the Pet Owner&rsquo;s emergency contact (if provided) to arrange alternative care. Should PFSC not be able to contact the Pet Owner or the emergency contact, PFSC will use its best judgment to find alternative care for the pet until the Pet Owner is able to retrieve his/her pet. If you are a Pet Owner, you authorize your pet&rsquo;s veterinarian(s) to release your pet&rsquo;s veterinary records to PFSC in connection with any such relocation or re-homing of your pet. In addition, you are responsible for and agree to pay all costs and expenses incurred by PFSC in connection with such transfer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2.8 Emergencies.</strong> We recommend that Pet Owners give their Service Providers contact information where they can be reached in the event medical care for a pet becomes necessary. Service Providers agree to immediately contact Pet Owners in the event such care becomes necessary or, if the Pet Owner is not available, to contact PFSC at the applicable telephone number or email address listed in the table at the end of these Terms. If you are a Pet Owner, you hereby authorize your Service Provider and PFSC to obtain and authorize the provision of veterinary care for your pet if you cannot be reached to authorize care yourself in an emergency situation. In such case, you also authorize your pet&rsquo;s veterinarian(s) to release your pet&rsquo;s veterinary records to PFSC. If your Service Provider reaches you with a request to authorize medical care for your pet and you refuse, you release the Service Provider and PFSC for any injury, damage or liability arising from failure to seek such care, including from reimbursement that may otherwise have been available under the PFSC Guarantee. Pet Owners are responsible for the costs of any such medical treatment for pets and, if you are a Pet Owner, you hereby authorize PFSC to charge your credit card or other payment method for such costs. In certain circumstances, a Pet Owner may be eligible for reimbursement under the PFSC Guarantee. PFSC recommends that all users have adequate pet insurance to cover the costs of veterinary care.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2.9 Consultation Services. </strong>PFSC may offer Pet Owners and Service Providers phone, chat, or email veterinary consultation services from a third party to provide an educational resource for decisions you make about your own pets or pets in your care. These consultation services are provided by a third party, and are not a part of the PFSC Service. If you use these third party consultation services, you should use them only in conjunction with, and not as a substitute for, professional veterinary care.

For example, Service Providers are invited to create a profile page with a photograph and other information and to transmit photos of the dogs under their care to Pet Owners, while Pet Owners may submit reviews of Service Providers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>7.2 License.</strong> Except for the limitations on our use and disclosure of personal information described in our Privacy Statement, to the maximum extent and duration permitted under any applicable law, you grant PFSC an irrevocable, perpetual, non-exclusive, fully paid worldwide license to use, copy, perform, publicly display, reproduce, adapt, modify, transmit, broadcast, prepare derivative works of, and/or distribute Your Content in connection with providing and/or promoting the PFSC Service, and to sublicense these rights to third parties.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>7.3 Release.</strong> If your name, voice, image, persona, likeness, or performance is included in any of Your Content, you hereby waive, and release PFSC and its users from, any claim or cause of action, whether known or unknown, for defamation, copyright infringement, invasion of the rights of privacy, publicity, or personality, or any similar claim arising out of the use of Your Content in accordance with the license in Section 7.2 and the other provisions of these Terms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>7.4 Your Representations and Warranties about Your Content.</strong> You represent and warrant that (1) you are the owner or licensor of Your Content, and that you have all rights, consents and permissions necessary to grant the license in Section 7.2 and make the release in Section 7.3 with respect to Your Content, (2) that you have any necessary consents and releases from individuals who appear or whose pets appear in Your Content; and (3) Your Content does not violate the law or these Terms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>7.5 Right to Remove or Screen Your Content.</strong> Though we are not obligated to do so, we reserve the right to monitor, screen, edit and/or remove Your Content on the PFSC Service. Our enforcement of these Terms with respect to Your Content is at our discretion, and failure to enforce the Terms in one instance does not create a waiver of our right to enforce them in another instance. We have no obligation to retain or provide you with copies of Your Content, nor will we have any liability to you for any deletion, disclosure, loss or modification to Your Content. It is your sole responsibility to maintain backup copies of Your Content.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>7.6 Reviews. </strong>The PFSC Service may provide the ability to leave public and/or private reviews of users or their pets.

We will have no liability to you for any deletion, disclosure, loss or modification of these reviews. We reserve the right to screen, edit or remove these reviews from the PFSC Service at any time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>8. Phone, Text and Mobile Communications.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>8.1 Consent to Autodialed Text Messages and Phone Calls&nbsp;This section 8.1 applies only to users in the United States.</strong> You consent to PFSC communicating with you about the PFSC Service by SMS, text message, email and other electronic means, including autodialed text messages and phone calls containing service information and/or marketing messages, even if your phone number is on the do-not-call list. Your carrier&#39;s normal messaging, data and other rates and fees will apply to these communications. You are not required to provide this consent to receive marketing messages as a condition of purchasing anything or using the PFSC Service, and you may opt-out of receiving these messages and calls at any time as described in our Privacy Statement (though you may continue to receive messages while PFSC processes your request).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>8.2 Phone Number Changes. </strong>In the event you deactivate a mobile phone number provided to us, you agree to update your PFSC account information promptly to ensure that messages are not sent to the person who acquires your old number.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>9. Fees &amp; Payment.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>9.1 Currency.</strong> All fees, deductible amounts and other payments referenced on, or charged through, the PFSC Service are listed and payable in local currency.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>9.2 Fees for Pet Owners. Pet Owners may purchase Pet Care Services from a Service Provider by completing a Booking as described in Section 2.5.</strong> If you are a Pet Owner, you enter into a transaction with the Service Provider when you accept a Booking, and you agree to pay the total fees indicated in the Booking. Except where otherwise specifically indicated on the PFSC Service, fees for Pet Care Services are determined by Service Providers. As described in Sections 9.3 and 9.4, the total amount Pet Owners are charged for a Booking may also include a service fee payable to PFSC. Where required by law, the amount charged will also be inclusive of applicable taxes. The Service Provider, not PFSC, is responsible for performing the Pet Care Services.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>9.3 Fees for Service Providers.</strong> Service Providers may agree to provide Pet Care Services to a Pet Owner by agreeing to a Booking as described in Section 2.5. If you are a Service Provider, you must confirm the Booking before it expires or the Pet Owner will have no obligation to complete the transaction. Once the Booking is completed by both parties, you agree to honor the price set forth in your Booking. The purchase of Pet Care Services is a transaction between the Pet Owner and the Service Provider. PFSC&rsquo;s role is to facilitate the transaction. We will (either directly or indirectly through an authorized third party) collect payment from the Pet Owner at the time of Booking and (except to the extent of any payment hold pursuant to Section 9.7) initiate payment to the Service Provider&rsquo;s account 48 hours after completion of the service period indicated in the Booking. Service Providers are charged a service fee as described in Section 9.4, which we deduct before remitting payment to Service Providers. Where required by law, the amount charged will also be inclusive of applicable taxes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>9.4 Service Fees.</strong> We charge service fees for some aspects of the PFSC Service. If you are a Service Provider, except where otherwise specified via the PFSC Service, our service fee is calculated as a percentage of the fees a Pet Owner agrees to pay to you in a Booking. We deduct this service fee from the amounts paid by the Pet Owner. Our service fees are described&nbsp;<a href="https://support.pfsc.com/hc/en-us/articles/205385304-What-are-the-service-fees-" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>9.5 Late Fees and Additional Charges.</strong> If you are a Pet Owner, you acknowledge and agree that, if you fail to retrieve your pet at the end of the service period agreed in a Booking, you will be charged for additional service time (<em>pro rata</em>&nbsp;for each partial late day) at the daily rate established in the Booking. In addition, you agree to indemnify PFSC from, and agree that we may charge your credit card or other payment method for, any additional costs and expenses we or the Service Provider incur as a result of your failure to retrieve your pet at the end of the service period agreed in a Booking.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>9.6 Cancellations &amp; Refunds.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><em>Booking Protection.</em>&nbsp;As more fully described on PFSC&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href="https://herosolutions.com.pk/sarim/pfsc/reservation-protection" target="_blank">Booking Protection</a>&nbsp;page, PFSC can help you find replacement Service Providers when Service Providers cancel Bookings near the start date of the service period identified in the Booking. The availability of the Booking Protection depends on the timing of the cancellation and the type of Pet Care Services provided; consult the&nbsp;<a href="https://herosolutions.com.pk/sarim/pfsc/reservation-protection" target="_blank">Booking Protection</a>&nbsp;page for details.</li>\r\n	<li><em>Cancellations by Service Provider.</em>&nbsp;If a Service Provider cancels a Booking prior to or during the service period identified in the Booking, we will refund the fees paid by the Pet Owner for Pet Care Services not provided, as well as any service charge paid to PFSC. If you are a Service Provider, you can appoint a substitute Service Provider (as agreed by the Pet Owner and so long as the substitute has an active account on the PFSC Service and has agreed in writing to accept a Booking) by contacting PFSC to modify the Booking. If you do not find a substitute and repeatedly cancel accepted Bookings without justification, PFSC may terminate your account.</li>\r\n	<li><em>Cancellations by Pet Owner.</em>&nbsp;If a Pet Owner cancels a Booking prior to or during the service period specified in a Booking, we will refund fees in accordance with the cancellation policy selected by the Service Provider on the PFSC Service. All Service Providers are required to select a cancellation policy prior to completing a Booking so that Pet Owners are aware of the cancellation policy prior to Booking. For more information about cancellation policies, please visit the&nbsp;<a href="https://herosolutions.com.pk/sarim/pfsc/help" target="_blank">Help Center</a>.</li>\r\n	<li><em>Force Majeure.</em>&nbsp;The cancellation policies described herein may not apply in the event of certain emergency situations beyond the control of Service Providers and/or Pet Owners that make it impossible or impractical to perform agreed Bookings, such as evacuations resulting from earthquake, hurricane, wildfire, flood, war, riots or other similar disaster. In such cases PFSC may, in its reasonable discretion, issue refunds under terms that vary from a Service Provider&rsquo;s selected cancellation policy.</li>\r\n	<li><em>Refunds for Failure to Perform.</em>&nbsp;If we determine in our reasonable discretion that a Service Provider has failed to provide Pet Care Services as agreed with the Pet Owner or is otherwise in breach of these Terms, then we may, in our reasonable discretion, cancel a Booking and/or issue a full or partial refund to a Pet Owner.</li>\r\n	<li><em>General Terms for Cancellations.</em>&nbsp;If you wish to cancel a Booking, you should use the mechanisms available through the PFSC Service to do so. For purposes of the policies and terms in this Section 9.6, the date of cancellation is the date that a user cancels through the PFSC Service, regardless of any separate communications between users outside of the PFSC Service.</li>\r\n	<li><em>Payment Disputes; Payment Outside of the PFSC Service.</em>&nbsp;PFSC initiates payments to Service Providers 48 hours after completion of a Booking. Once these amounts have been disbursed, any further payment disputes are between the Pet Owner and Service Provider, and PFSC has no obligation to mediate or facilitate any resolution. Further, PFSC has no responsibility or liability with respect to any tips, bonuses, or other payments made outside of the PFSC Service.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>9.7 Payment Holds.</strong> If you are a Service Provider, PFSC reserves the right to issue a hold on amounts otherwise payable to you pursuant to Section 9.3 if there is a reasonable suspicion of fraudulent activity involving your account(s) or for other similarly compelling reason involving protection of PFSC, the PFSC community or third party rights. We may also recommend that third party payment service providers restrict your access to funds in your account under the same circumstances.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>9.8 Authorization to Charge.</strong> When you pay for Pet Care Services or for other services on the PFSC Service, you will be required to provide us with valid, up-to-date credit card or other payment information and to maintain that payment information (or an acceptable alternative payment method) on file with your account so long as you have any outstanding, confirmed Bookings. You authorize us to charge your credit card or other payment method for fees you incur on the PFSC Service as they become due and payable, and to charge any alternative payment method PFSC has on record for you in the event your primary payment method is expired, invalid, or otherwise not able to be charged. You are responsible for maintaining up-to-date payment information. If we cannot charge you for fees when due because your payment information is no longer valid, or if we do not receive your payment when due, then you understand that neither PFSC nor the Service Provider will be responsible for any failure to provide services associated with those fees. Except as expressly provided in these Terms, all fees paid via the PFSC Service are non-refundable once paid.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>9.9 Taxes</strong>. Except for taxes on PFSC&rsquo;s income and gross receipts or where PFSC is otherwise required to collect taxes, you acknowledge that you are solely responsible to pay any applicable taxes that arise as a result of your purchase, provision, or use of Pet Care Services via the PFSC Service. This includes, without limitation, any form of sales tax, VAT, or income tax on fees paid or received by you through the PFSC Service.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>10. Background Checks and Identity Verifications.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>PFSC may provide Service Providers with access to third party consumer reporting agencies that perform, among other things, personal identification verification services (&ldquo;Identity Verification&rdquo;) or criminal records checks, sex offender registry checks, motor vehicle records checks and/or identification verifications (collectively, &ldquo;Background Checks&rdquo;). Outside of the US and Canada, these services are limited to Identity Verification. We do not provide, and are not responsible or liable in any manner for, the Background Checks or Identity Verifications, and we do not endorse or make any representations or warranties regarding the reliability of such Background Checks or Identity Verifications or the accuracy, timeliness or completeness of any information in the Background Checks or Identity Verifications. We do not independently verify information in the Background Checks or Identity Verifications.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you undergo a Background Check or Identity Verification via the PFSC Service, you hereby consent to the collection, use and disclosure of the information in the Background Check or Identity Verification, and you agree to provide complete and accurate information for your Background Check or Identity Verification. You understand and agree that PFSC may, in its sole discretion, review and rely on the information in the Background Check or Identity Verification in deciding whether to suspend or terminate or investigate a complaint about a Service Provider, but also that we are not obligated to do so, and are not responsible or liable in any way in the event that any information in any Background Check or Identity Verification is not accurate, timely or complete. If you are the subject of a Background Check or Identity Verification, you may contact the applicable third-party consumer reporting agency to dispute the accuracy, timeliness or completeness of such information. You agree that PFSC&rsquo;s rights and obligations under the Arbitration Agreement inure to the benefit of the consumer reporting agency used for Background Checks or Identity Verification in respect of any claim that would be subject to the Arbitration Agreement if brought against us. PFSC reserves the right to suspend or terminate your access to the PFSC Service based on information in the Background Check or Identity Verification or for any other reason, or no reason, in our sole discretion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pet Owners remain fully responsible to evaluate and investigate their Service Providers.&nbsp;Be aware of the following limitations in Background Checks: Except as otherwise expressly provided in these Terms or through the Service, PFSC does not automatically run Background Checks on any Users.&nbsp;Background Checks may vary by type, breadth and depth.&nbsp;Records not available to third-party Background Check agencies will not be included in the results.&nbsp;Not all arrest logs and records, conviction and correction records, sex offender registries and motor vehicle records are available in all jurisdictions.&nbsp;In many jurisdictions there is a delay before arrest logs and records, conviction and correction records, sex offender registries and motor vehicle records are included in Background Checks.&nbsp;Juvenile records and offenses for minors may not appear in the public record and are therefore not included in the results.&nbsp;Dismissed cases, arrests not resulting in convictions, arrests or convictions in foreign countries and nolle prosequi (abandonment of prosecution) may not be reported.&nbsp;Traffic violations are not included unless a jurisdiction reports them as criminal offenses.&nbsp;In the jurisdictions where traffic violations are reported as criminal offenses, such traffic violations may be included in the results as misdemeanors or felonies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>11.

WE RESERVE THE RIGHT TO ASSUME THE EXCLUSIVE DEFENSE AND CONTROL OF ANY MATTER SUBJECT TO INDEMNIFICATION UNDER THIS SECTION, AND YOU WILL NOT SETTLE ANY SUCH CLAIM OR MATTER WITHOUT OUR ADVANCE WRITTEN CONSENT.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>14.

As a condition of exercising such license, you agree that (1) all goodwill associated with your use of the PFSC Marks inures solely to the benefit of PFSC, and (2) such license immediately terminates upon your ceasing to be a Service Provider in good standing, whether at your own option or because PFSC suspends or terminates your rights to use the PFSC Service.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>15. Warranty Disclaimer for the PFSC Service.</strong>&nbsp;The information and materials found on the PFSC Service, including text, graphics, information, links or other items, are provided &quot;as is&quot; and &quot;as available.&quot; Reviews, profiles, advice, opinions, statements, offers, or other information or content made available through the PFSC Service, but not directly by PFSC, are those of their respective authors, who are solely responsible for such content.

Unless you opt out of the Arbitration Agreement in accordance with the procedure described in Section 17.9 below, you and PFSC (together, the &ldquo;Parties&rdquo;) agree that any and all disputes or claims that arise between you and PFSC relating to the PFSC Service, interactions with others on the PFSC Service, and/or these Terms (including any alleged breach of these Terms) (collectively, &ldquo;Claims&rdquo;), except for Excluded Claims (defined in the following sentence), will be resolved as set forth in this Arbitration Agreement. As used herein, &ldquo;Excluded Claims&rdquo; means (1) individual claims brought in small claims court (if your claims qualify), (2) claims arising out of or related to a violation of Section 4.1, above, (3) claims in which either party seeks injunctive or other equitable relief for the alleged unlawful use of intellectual property (including, without limitation, copyrights, trademarks, trade names, logos, trade secrets or patents), and (4) claims that, as a matter of applicable law, cannot be made subject to arbitration.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>17.2 Agreement to Arbitrate. </strong>Unless you opt out of the Arbitration Agreement in accordance with the procedure described in Section 17.9 below, you agree that any and all Claims (other than Excluded Claims) will be resolved exclusively&nbsp;on an individual basis through final and binding arbitration, rather than in a court,&nbsp;in accordance with this Arbitration Agreement, and&nbsp;your rights in connection with all Claims (other than Excluded Claims) will be determined by a neutral arbitrator, not by a judge or jury. The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement. To the extent that the Parties&#39; dispute involves both timely filed Excluded Claims and other Claims subject to this Agreement, the Parties agree to bifurcate and stay for the duration of the arbitration proceedings any such Excluded Claims.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>17.3 Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief.</strong>&nbsp;YOU AND PFSC AGREE THAT, UNLESS YOU OPT OUT OF THE ARBITRATION AGREEMENT IN ACCORDANCE WITH SECTION 17.9 BELOW, EACH OF US MAY BRING CLAIMS (EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT THAT THE RIGHT TO BRING A CLAIM IN A PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION CANNOT BE WAIVED AS A MATTER OF LAW) AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR PROCEEDING.&nbsp;UNLESS BOTH YOU AND PFSC AGREE OTHERWISE (OR TO THE EXTENT THAT THE RIGHT TO BRING A CLAIM IN A PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION CANNOT BE WAIVED AS A MATTER OF LAW), THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE OR JOIN MORE THAN ONE PERSON&#39;S OR PARTY&#39;S CLAIMS AND MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A CONSOLIDATED, REPRESENTATIVE, OR CLASS PROCEEDING.&nbsp;ALSO, THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD RELIEF (INCLUDING MONETARY, INJUNCTIVE, AND DECLARATORY RELIEF) ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF NECESSITATED BY THAT PARTY&#39;S INDIVIDUAL CLAIM(S). ANY RELIEF AWARDED CANNOT AFFECT OTHER PFSC SERVICE USERS.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>17.4 Pre-Arbitration Dispute Resolution. </strong>Before you commence arbitration, we suggest that you contact us to explain your complaint. Our preference will always be to resolve complaints amicably and efficiently, without the need for arbitration. You may contact us via email at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:legal@pfsc.com" target="_blank">legal@pfsc.com</a>&nbsp;or by mail at A Place for PFSC, Inc., Attn: Legal, 711 Capitol Way S., Suite 204, Olympia, WA 98501. If the issue is not resolved and results in arbitration, we will need to mutually select and agree upon an arbitrator and the rules and procedures to govern the arbitration.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>17.5 Arbitration Procedures.</strong> The Parties will try in good faith to mutually select and agree upon an arbitrator and rules and procedures to govern the arbitration. If we cannot agree, then the arbitration will be conducted in English by a neutral arbitrator in accordance with your choice of the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures (the &ldquo;JAMS Rules&rdquo;) or the Rules of the International Center for Dispute Resolution (the &ldquo;ICDR Rules&rdquo;), as modified by this Arbitration Agreement. The rules that apply are those in effect when arbitration is demanded by either of the Parties. The JAMS Rules are available at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.jamsadr.com/rules-streamlined-arbitration" target="_blank">https://www.jamsadr.com/rules-streamlined-arbitration</a>, and the ICDR Rules are available at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.icdr.org/rules_forms_fees" target="_blank">https://www.icdr.org/rules_forms_fees</a>, and both Rules are incorporated in these Terms by reference. You either acknowledge and agree that you have read and understand the Rules or waive your opportunity to read the Rules and any claim that the Rules are unfair or should not apply for any reason. If there is any inconsistency between the Rules and this Arbitration Agreement, the terms of this Arbitration Agreement will control unless the arbitrator determines that the application of the inconsistent Arbitration Agreement terms would not result in a fundamentally fair arbitration. The arbitrator must also follow the provisions of these Terms as a court would, including without limitation, the limitation of liability provisions in Section 16. Although arbitration proceedings are usually simpler and more streamlined than trials and other judicial proceedings, the arbitrator can award the same damages and relief on an individual basis that a court can award to an individual under the Terms and applicable law. The arbitrator shall submit a decision in writing, specifying the findings of fact and the conclusions of law on which the decision is based. Decisions by the arbitrator are binding and enforceable in court and may be overturned by a court only for very limited reasons.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The arbitration will be held in the county in which you reside or at another mutually agreed location. If the value of the relief sought is $10,000 USD (or equivalent in local currency) or less, you or PFSC may elect to have the arbitration conducted by telephone or based solely on written submissions, which election will be binding on you and PFSC subject to the arbitrator&#39;s discretion to require an in-person hearing, if the circumstances warrant. Attendance at any in-person hearing may be made by telephone by you and/or PFSC, unless the arbitrator requires otherwise.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The arbitrator will decide the substance of all claims in accordance with the laws of the State of Washington (or of England and Wales if you are located outside of the United States or Canada), including recognized principles of equity, and will honor all claims of privilege recognized by law. The arbitrator will not be bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving different PFSC users, but is bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving the same PFSC user to the extent required by applicable law. As limited by applicable law, these Terms and the applicable JAMS Rules, the arbitrator will have (1) the exclusive authority and jurisdiction to make all procedural and substantive decisions regarding a Claim, including the determination of whether a Claim is arbitrable, and (2) the authority to grant any remedy that would otherwise be available in court.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>17.6 Costs of Arbitration.</strong> Payment of all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees (collectively, the &quot;Arbitration Fees&quot;) will be shared equally by you and PFSC, except where prohibited by applicable law. In addition, (1) if you demonstrate to the arbitrator that you are economically unable to pay your portion of the Arbitration Fees or if the arbitrator otherwise determines for any reason that you should not be required to pay your portion of the Arbitration Fees, PFSC will pay your portion of such fees, and (2) if you demonstrate to the arbitrator that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation, PFSC will pay as much of the Arbitration Fees as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive. Each party will be solely responsible for all other fees it incurs in connection with the arbitration, including without limitation, all attorney fees. In the event the arbitrator determines the claim(s) you assert in the arbitration to be frivolous, you agree to reimburse PFSC for all fees associated with the arbitration paid by PFSC on your behalf that you otherwise would be obligated to pay under the JAMS or ICDR Rules.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>17.7 Confidentiality.</strong> All aspects of the arbitration proceeding, and any ruling, decision or award by the arbitrator, will be strictly confidential for the benefit of all parties.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>17.8 Severability</strong>. If any term, clause or provision of this Section 17 is held invalid or unenforceable, it will be so held to the minimum extent required by law, and all other terms, clauses and provisions of this Section 17 will remain valid and enforceable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>17.9 Opt-Out Procedure.</strong> You can choose to reject this Arbitration Agreement by mailing us a written opt-out notice (&quot;Opt-Out Notice&quot;) in accordance with the terms of this Section 17.9. The Opt-Out Notice must be postmarked no later than 30 days after the date you accept these Terms for the first time. You must mail the Opt-Out Notice to A Place for PFSC, Inc., Attn: Legal, 711 Capitol Way S., Suite 204, Olympia, WA 98501. The Opt-Out Notice must state that you do not agree to the Arbitration Agreement and must include your name, address, phone number, and the email address(es) used to register for the PFSC Service to which the opt-out applies. You must sign the Opt-Out Notice for it to be effective. This procedure is the only way you can opt out of the Arbitration Agreement. If you opt out of the Arbitration Agreement, the entire Arbitration Agreement will not apply with respect to you, but the remainder of these Terms will continue to apply. Opting out of this Arbitration Agreement has no effect on any previous, other, or future arbitration agreements that you may have with us. By opting out of binding arbitration, you are agreeing to resolve Claims (including Excluded Claims) in accordance with Section 18.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>17.10 Future Changes to this Arbitration Agreement.</strong> Notwithstanding any provision in these Terms to the contrary, you agree that if we make any change to this Arbitration Agreement (other than a change to any notice address or website link provided herein) in the future, that change will not apply to any claim that was filed in a legal proceeding against PFSC prior to the effective date of the change. Moreover, if we terminate this Arbitration Agreement by removing it from these Terms, such termination will not be effective until 30 days after the version of these Terms not containing the Arbitration Agreement is posted to the Site, and will not be effective as to any claim that was filed in a legal proceeding against PFSC prior to the effective date of removal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>18. Governing Law and Jurisdiction.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>For users in the United States and Canada, these Terms, and any dispute between you and PFSC, will be governed by the laws of the State of Georgia, without regard to principles of conflicts of law, except that the Federal Arbitration Act will govern the interpretation and enforcement of Section 17 (the Arbitration Agreement). Unless you and we agree otherwise, or except where prohibited by applicable law, in the event that the Arbitration Agreement is found not to apply to you or to a particular claim or dispute, you agree that any claim or dispute that arises between you and PFSC must be resolved exclusively by a state or federal court located in the State of Washington. You and PFSC agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts located within Seattle, Washington for the purpose of litigating all such claims or disputes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>19. Miscellaneous. </strong>Nothing in this Agreement will be construed as making either party the partner, joint venturer, agent, legal representative, employer, worker, or employee of the other. Neither party will have, or hold itself out to any third party as having, any authority to make any statements, representations or commitments of any kind, or to take any action, that will be binding on the other, except as provided for herein or authorized in writing by the party to be bound. The invalidity, illegality or unenforceability of any term or provision of these Terms will in no way effect the validity, legality or enforceability of any other term or provision of these Terms. In the event a term or provision is determined to be invalid or unenforceable, the parties agree to replace such term or provision with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term or provision, and these Terms will be enforceable as so modified. To the maximum extent possible under applicable local law, this Agreement will be binding on and will inure to the benefit of the legal representatives, successors and assigns of the parties hereto.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For questions or concerns about the PFSC Service or these Terms, please refer to the PFSC&nbsp;<a href="https://herosolutions.com.pk/sarim/pfsc/help" target="_blank">Help Center</a>, or contact your local office:</p>\r\n');

We offer the Guarantee because we believe that being there for our community is a fundamental part of what it means to be The Dog People.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Read on for specifics about the Guarantee, including what&#39;s covered, how it works, and frequently asked questions.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>The Details</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The PFSC Guarantee reimburses members of our community for costs arising from certain injuries or damages that occur during a service booked and paid through PFSC. The injuries or damages must result from care provided during a PFSC stay or walk, and the Guarantee reimburses in the event the sitter or walker is unwilling or unable to pay those costs. In certain cases, the Guarantee may also be used to reimburse for injuries to resident pets owned by sitters or dog walkers.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>What&#39;s covered?</h3>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Vet care for injuries to a &ldquo;PFSC Dog&rdquo;&mdash;i.e., a pet owner&#39;s pet(s) in a sitter&rsquo;s or dog walker&#39;s care, custody, and control</li>\r\n	<li>Vet care for injuries to the sitter&rsquo;s or walker&rsquo;s resident pet(s) caused by a PFSC Dog (in cases where the pet owner may be otherwise liable)</li>\r\n	<li>Physical damage to a pet owner&rsquo;s personal property caused by the sitter or walker</li>\r\n	<li>Direct damages from injury to certain third parties caused by a PFSC Dog</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3>What&#39;s not covered?</h3>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Injury or damage that arises during a Meet &amp; Greet or otherwise outside of the service dates of a confirmed PFSC booking</li>\r\n	<li>Long-term vet care&mdash;i.e., care that extends more than 30 days past injury</li>\r\n	<li>Treatment costs for preventive care, or medical or veterinary bills resulting from an illness or a chronic or pre-existing condition</li>\r\n	<li>Preventable conditions such as fleas, ticks, or parasites</li>\r\n	<li>Damage to a pet owner&rsquo;s property caused by his or her own pets, or damage to the property of a pet care provider or someone related to or residing with the pet care provider</li>\r\n	<li>Injury to the pet care provider or pet owner, or someone related to or residing with the pet care provider or pet owner</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3>What are the monetary limits?</h3>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Reimbursement for veterinary care is limited to a total amount of&nbsp;$25,000&nbsp;per incident</li>\r\n	<li>Reimbursement for pet owner property damage or third-party injuries is limited to&nbsp;$1,000,000&nbsp;per incident</li>\r\n	<li>All reimbursements are subject to a minimum contribution of&nbsp;$250&nbsp;by the claimant&mdash;so we reimburse only for costs exceeding $250</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3>Are there other conditions, exclusions, or limitations?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Yes. For example, injuries or damage involving automobiles or other vehicles, injury or damage caused by natural disasters or other uncontrollable events, or damage to precious goods such as fine art or family heirlooms, are excluded. For a complete understanding of the PFSC Guarantee, including the full list of conditions, exclusions and limitations, we strongly encourage you to read the PFSC Guarantee Terms and Conditions, which are part and parcel of PFSC&#39;s Terms of Service.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Is the PFSC Guarantee an insurance plan?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>No. The PFSC Guarantee exists to fill the gap when the responsible party&mdash;usually the pet care provider&mdash;is unable or unwilling to pay for costs arising from damage or injury attributable to his or her negligence, and when insurance is not available. It is a contractual agreement from PFSC to protect its users, enforceable in accordance with the PFSC Guarantee Terms and Conditions. Reimbursement under the PFSC Guarantee is generally paid out of PFSC&rsquo;s own pocket&mdash;though we reserve the right to refer a claim to our insurance carriers when necessary or appropriate.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Before filing a claim for reimbursement:</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>In many cases, PFSC&rsquo;s Trust &amp; Safety team (888-727-1140) can help users take immediate steps to mitigate the injury or damage caused by an incident, such as connecting you with a board-certified veterinarian by phone or marshaling resources to locate a lost dog. For this reason, we ask both sitters and pet owners to notify us as soon as possible after an incident occurs&mdash;and in any event no later than 48 hours after the booking. We can&rsquo;t help what we don&rsquo;t know about, so make us your first call!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When it comes to reimbursement, however, we know from experience that issues are often best resolved by simply reaching out to the other party. Before filing a claim for reimbursement under the PFSC Guarantee, try contacting the other party through your PFSC inbox. If you&#39;re unable to come to an agreement informally, let us know.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, if you have insurance that may cover some or all costs arising from an injury or damage otherwise falling under the PFSC Guarantee, such as pet or homeowner&rsquo;s insurance, you should file a claim under that policy before seeking reimbursement from PFSC. In such a case the PFSC Guarantee may be leveraged to meet deductibles or cover costs that fall outside your policy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you are unable to reach an agreement with the responsible party and don&rsquo;t have insurance to cover costs arising from an injury or damage covered under the PFSC Guarantee, you can submit a claim for reimbursement as outlined below.</p>\r\n'),
